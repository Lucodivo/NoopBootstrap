I have a tendency to want to spin up a new project and try something new. This repository hopefully makes that process
a whole lot easier. 

### Included Dependencies

keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D"](https://www.libsdl.org/)
  - Included as a submodule. Builds alongside the CMake project.
